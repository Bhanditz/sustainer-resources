### Email to explain benefits of starting increasing a contribution
_This is an email that Vincent Voyer and Josh dzielak from Algolia used to start a conversation internally about supporting Open Source. They kindly agreed to share it as a template! <3_


Subject: Supporting open-source projects that are critical to us
Body: tl;dr; Every squad gets $100 (monthly recurring) to sponsor open source projects they rely on, via OpenCollective. Fill the form to name projects you want to support.

Hi all! There was a recent exchange between SendGrid and an npmjs employee that went like that: 
- SendGrid: "Hey can you help us with this open source project" (= code for free) 
- Npmjs employee: "Since you raised $80M, maybe you could also contribute money to open source?"

This made us think: are we contributing money to open source to a reasonable level given our own usage of it?

We don't want to do it just for the sake of being able to answer: "Hey! We DO support open source" when the finger is pointed at you like SendGrid, we believe there's more than that for us.

Sustainability in open source is key. When our stack depends heavily on some projects, we can contribute with code (if we have time) but also with money. It might even be easier and cost less to contribute with some money, since contributing with code also costs us a lot of money (we will spend time fixing open source projects instead of focusing on our core business).

Not only do we ensure that those projects can be continued on the long term, but we can also use our own contributions as a way to communicate on our usage of open source projects.

Discussing with Josh, we came out with an idea: allow $100 per team per month to sponsor projects of their choice.

With eleven squads today, this represents an annual cost of $13.200 per year. Over a ten year span, we will have given $132,000 to open source projects we rely on. How many engineers would we have to hire and pay if some critical open-source projects did not exists? A lot probably. The maintenance of Babel is the continuous work of dozen of people.

Is this really necessary? To give you an example, the XX deal with the XX project is $XXXXX per month. The XXX project heavily relies on a DOM parsing library (cheerio) that today gets $322 per month from donations. Without this library, we would have had to write our own, make it fast, make it robust. That would have taken us weeks! We feel like we could contribute money to cheerio.

How is the money used? Every project transparently details it: https://opencollective.com/webpack/expenses.

What are the benefits for the company? It shows we #care for the projects we rely on, deeply. Both internally and from the outside. It minimizes the odds of depending on unmaintained projects. We could use this as a communication opportunity and explain how every squad at Algolia can support the projects they use.

Again, the goal is not to sponsor only for communication purposes. We do want to support projects them because we care.

Let us know what you think.

Vincent & Josh.

PS: We may want to open this initiative to other squads. If you feel the same, give us feedback.

# Additional Benefits you can quote:
Doing this will reinforce the sentiment of belonging to a company that deeply cares about what we use and how are own developers perceive the money we spend and our leadership team.

Frame it as the companyâ€™s holiday season community gift

Think about the marketing / communication benefits.
